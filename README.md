# Multithreading 
## ManualResetEvent

The ManualResetEvent class in C# is another synchronization primitive that is part of the threading namespace and is used to control thread execution. Unlike AutoResetEvent, which automatically resets its state to non-signaled after a single waiting thread is released, ManualResetEvent requires manual control of its state. This means that once it is signaled, it remains in a signaled state until it is manually reset to non-signaled, allowing multiple waiting threads to proceed.

Key Features of ManualResetEvent:
Signaled State: When in the signaled state, it allows all waiting threads, or any thread that approaches the event after it is signaled, to proceed.
Non-Signaled State: In the non-signaled state, it blocks any threads trying to enter until it is manually set to signaled.
Manual Control: The state of the ManualResetEvent does not automatically change when a thread is released. It must be manually reset to non-signaled when desired.

### Common Use Cases:
Broad Notification: ManualResetEvent is useful for scenarios where an event needs to be signaled for multiple threads at once, such as notifying threads that a particular condition has been met or that an operation has completed.
Thread Coordination: It allows for coordination among multiple threads, especially handy in scenarios involving a setup phase followed by a concurrent execution phase.

### Here’s how it works:

When a ManualResetEvent is created, it can be either in a signaled or non-signaled state.
If the ManualResetEvent is in a signaled state, any thread calling WaitOne on this event will proceed immediately.
If it is in a non-signaled state, threads calling WaitOne will block until the event is set to a signaled state.
To change the state to signaled, you call the Set method.
To change the state to non-signaled, you call the Reset method.
This type of synchronization mechanism is useful for allowing multiple threads to wait for an event to occur and then proceed once the event is signaled, maintaining the signal state until explicitly reset. This can be particularly useful in scenarios where the state needs to be checked by multiple threads or where the condition being waited on may occur multiple times or sporadically.

## AutoResetEvent
The AutoResetEvent class in C# is a synchronization primitive that can be either in a signaled or non-signaled state and is used to coordinate activities between threads. It's called "auto-reset" because it automatically resets its state to non-signaled after releasing a single waiting thread.

### Key Features of AutoResetEvent:
Signaled State: When an AutoResetEvent is in the signaled state, it allows one waiting thread to proceed.
Non-Signaled State: In the non-signaled state, AutoResetEvent blocks any threads trying to enter until it is signaled.
Auto-Reset Behavior: After releasing a thread, the state of the AutoResetEvent automatically reverts to non-signaled. This means that subsequent threads will block until it is explicitly set to signaled again.
### Common Use Cases:
Event Handling: AutoResetEvent is often used to notify a thread that a particular event has occurred, allowing the thread to handle the event.
Thread Synchronization: It helps in synchronizing activities among multiple threads, ensuring that operations occur in a controlled and expected sequence.

## Lock

In C#, the lock keyword is a synchronization primitive used to ensure that one and only one thread can enter a particular block of code at one time. This is crucial when you have multiple threads that need to access or modify shared data or resources, as it prevents race conditions, which can lead to data corruption or unpredictable behavior.
The lock keyword in C# is a convenient way to use the Monitor class for managing access to a critical section of code.
```bash
// Explicit use of Monitor
Monitor.Enter(lockObject);
try
{
    sharedResource++;
}
finally
{
    Monitor.Exit(lockObject);
}
```

### Key Features of lock:
Mutual Exclusion: The lock keyword enforces mutual exclusion, meaning that only one thread can enter the critical section of code at a time.
Scope-Based Locking: lock works within the scope where it is declared. Once the scope is exited (usually at the end of the block), the lock is automatically released.
Underlying Implementation: Internally, lock is a syntactic shortcut for a Monitor.Enter followed by a try-finally block where Monitor.Exit is called in the finally clause. This ensures that the lock is released properly even if an exception occurs within the locked block.
### Common Use Cases:
Thread Safety: Ensuring that shared data is accessed by only one thread at a time to prevent corruption.
Resource Management: Managing access to resources that cannot be concurrently accessed by multiple threads.

## Semaphore

A Semaphore is a synchronization primitive used to control access to a common resource by multiple threads in a concurrent system. It operates by maintaining a count of permits – the count represents the number of times the semaphore can be acquired before a thread needs to wait.

### Key Features of Semaphore:
Limit Concurrent Access: Semaphores are used to limit the number of threads that can access a particular resource or a pool of resources at the same time.
Manage Resource Allocations: It can manage a fixed number of resources by controlling how many threads can access the resource simultaneously.
Signal and Wait Mechanism: Threads can signal (release) the semaphore when they are done with a resource, or wait for a signal if the semaphore count is zero, indicating no resources are available.
### Common Use Cases:
Resource Pool Management: Managing access to a pool of resources such as database connections or network connections.
Concurrency Control: Limiting the number of threads performing a particular action at the same time to prevent resource thrashing or overloading.
### Types of Semaphores:
Binary Semaphore: A specialization of a semaphore that can hold only a single permit, often used similarly to a mutex for resource locking.
Counting Semaphore: A semaphore that holds more than one permit, allowing multiple threads to acquire the semaphore concurrently up to a maximum limit.

## TaskCompletionSource
The TaskCompletionSource<T> class in C# is a versatile and powerful mechanism used in asynchronous programming to create tasks that do not bind directly to a delegate. It allows you to manually control the state of a task, including setting its result, signaling its cancellation, or marking it as failed with an exception. This manual control makes TaskCompletionSource<T> especially useful for bridging traditional asynchronous programming patterns with the newer Task-based asynchronous pattern introduced in .NET 4.

### Key Features of TaskCompletionSource<T>:
Manual Task Management: TaskCompletionSource<T> provides methods to manually set the result, exception, or cancellation of a task, giving full control over its completion.
Decoupling of Task Creation and Execution: It decouples the initiation and completion of asynchronous operations, allowing tasks to be completed from any thread or event.
Integration with Async/Await: The Task object created by TaskCompletionSource<T> can be awaited, making it integrate seamlessly with the async/await syntax.

### Common Use Cases:
Interfacing with Non-Task-Based Asynchronous Patterns: Useful for adapting older asynchronous models (like event-based asynchrony or IAsyncResult pattern) to the newer Task-based pattern.
Implementing Custom Asynchronous Operations: Ideal for scenarios where you need to implement custom asynchronous operations that aren't directly based on I/O or other system operations.

## ThreadPool

The ThreadPool in .NET is a collection of worker threads that efficiently manage the execution of short-lived asynchronous tasks without the overhead of creating and destroying individual threads for each task. By reusing existing threads, the thread pool reduces the resource consumption associated with thread management, making it more efficient for applications that perform a large number of small, asynchronous operations.

### Key Features of ThreadPool:
Thread Reuse: Threads are reused for multiple tasks, minimizing the overhead of thread creation and destruction.
Task Queuing: Tasks are queued and executed as threads become available, ensuring that a limited number of threads handle a potentially large number of tasks.
Managed by Runtime: The size and management of the thread pool are handled automatically by the .NET runtime, although it can be adjusted manually if needed.
### Common Use Cases:
Handling Asynchronous Workloads: Ideal for applications that need to handle multiple small tasks asynchronously, such as handling client requests in a web server.
Improving Application Performance: By minimizing the overhead associated with thread management, the thread pool can help improve the performance of applications that need to execute many short-lived tasks.

## Barier


The Barrier class in C# is a synchronization primitive that enables multiple threads (known as participants) to work concurrently on an algorithm in phases. Each participant performs its work until it reaches the barrier point, where it waits for all other participants to reach the same barrier point. Only when all participants have reached this point can all of them proceed to the next phase of computation. This pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where a group of threads need to perform multiple steps in a coordinated manner and each step depends on the completion of the previous step by all threads.

### Key Features of Barrier:
Phase Coordination: A Barrier helps coordinate multiple threads in a multi-phase operation where each phase must be completed by all threads before moving on to the next.
Post-Phase Action: The Barrier class allows specifying an action that executes after all participants reach the barrier and just before they are released to continue their work. This action is executed by only one of the participant threads.
Participant Management: Participants can be dynamically added to or removed from the barrier. This allows for flexible participation across different phases if the number of operating threads needs to change.
### Common Use Cases:
Parallel Algorithms: Useful in scenarios where an algorithm can be broken down into steps that need to be executed in a sequence, with each step requiring all threads to synchronize before proceeding.
Complex Workflow Coordination: Managing complex workflows that require threads to periodically synchronize to share results or state before continuing.
